This is very simple python program that I use at work. 
Program runs under android, It translates ean codes to internal codes of my company. It can translate them in opposite direction too.
The codes are stored in external file. Program can scan ean code ussing phone camera so user do not have to write them manualy. It uses camera frames stored in memory so It doesnt need to have android permission to write.
